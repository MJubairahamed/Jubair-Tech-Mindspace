### **Python Programming Paradigm**

* Python is a **multi-paradigm programming language**, meaning it supports:

  * **Procedural programming** (step-by-step instructions, structured code).
  * **Functional programming** (treating functions as first-class citizens, immutability, and higher-order functions).
  * **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** (using classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism).
* Flexibility allows developers to **choose the best paradigm** depending on the problem.

### **Procedural Programming in Python**

* Follows a **top-down approach** with step-by-step instructions.
* Code is organized into **functions and procedures**.
* Emphasizes **reusability and modularity**.
* Easy to understand for beginners, suitable for simple scripts and tasks.
* Example: Writing a function to compute factorial using loops.

### **Functional Programming in Python**

* Focuses on **what to solve, not how to solve it** (declarative style).
* Functions are **first-class citizens** (can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions).
* Encourages **immutability** and avoids shared state or side effects.
* Uses **higher-order functions** like `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, and **lambdas**.
* Example: Computing factorial using recursion or `reduce()`.

### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python**

* Based on the concept of **objects and classes**.
* Promotes **abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism**.
* Enables code **reusability, scalability, and maintainability**.
* Encourages modeling real-world entities into software objects.
* Example: Defining a `Car` class with properties (color, speed) and methods (drive, stop).
