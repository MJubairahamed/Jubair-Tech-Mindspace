## Genereal Interview Questions

### **General Java Questions**
### **1. **Explain the difference between `HashMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, and `TreeMap`.**
   - **Answer**:  
     - `HashMap` is **unordered** and offers O(1) time complexity for insert, delete, and search.
     - `LinkedHashMap` maintains **insertion order** and performs slightly slower than `HashMap`.
     - `TreeMap` maintains **sorted order** (according to keys) and offers O(log n) time complexity.

### **2. **How does Java handle memory management, and what is garbage collection?**
   - **Answer**:  
     Java uses **automatic memory management** with the help of **Garbage Collection (GC)**. GC reclaims unused objects in **heap memory**. The key GC algorithms include:
     - **Serial GC** (for small applications)
     - **Parallel GC** (for multi-threaded applications)
     - **G1 GC** (for low-latency applications)
     - **ZGC & Shenandoah** (for ultra-low-latency needs)

### **3. **What is the difference between `Callable` and `Runnable`?**
   - **Answer**:  
     - `Runnable` runs on a separate thread but **cannot return a result**.
     - `Callable<V>` allows returning a value and can **throw checked exceptions**.

### **4. **Explain the SOLID principles in Java.**
   - **Answer**:
     - **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP) â€“ A class should have **one reason to change**.
     - **O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP) â€“ A class should be **open for extension but closed for modification**.
     - **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP) â€“ Subtypes must be **interchangeable** with their base types.
     - **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP) â€“ Prefer **small, specific interfaces** over large, general ones.
     - **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP) â€“ Depend on **abstractions, not concrete implementations**.
    
        
### **5. **What is the difference between `@Transactional` and `propagation` in Spring?**
   - **Answer**:  
     - `@Transactional` ensures database operations are atomic (all succeed or fail).
     - `Propagation` defines how transactions interact when one method calls another:
       - `REQUIRED` (default) â€“ Uses an existing transaction or creates one.
       - `REQUIRES_NEW` â€“ Always starts a new transaction.
       - `NESTED` â€“ Runs within a parent transaction but can roll back independently.

### **6. `volatile` Variable:**  
- Used for **multi-threading** to ensure **visibility** of variable changes across threads.  
- Prevents **caching** of the variable by threads, ensuring every read fetches the latest value from main memory.  
- Does **not guarantee atomicity** for compound operations (e.g., `x++`).  
- Example:  
  ```java
  class Example {
      volatile int counter = 0; // Changes visible to all threads
  }
  ```  

### **7. `transient` Variable:**  
- Used in **serialization** to prevent storing a variable's value when an object is serialized.  
- Useful for sensitive data like **passwords** or **temporary variables**.  
- Upon deserialization, the variable is reset to its **default value** (`null`, `0`, `false`, etc.).  
- Example:  
  ```java
  class Example implements Serializable {
      transient int tempData; // Will not be serialized
  }
  ```  

ðŸš€ **Key Difference:** `volatile` ensures **visibility in multi-threading**, while `transient` prevents **serialization** of variables.
