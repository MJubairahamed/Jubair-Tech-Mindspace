Here are some **scenario-based Java Collections questions** that can be asked in an interview for an **experienced Java developer (10+ years)**. These focus on real-world problems, best practices, and optimizations.

## **ðŸ”¹ Scenario-Based Java Collections Questions**
| # | **Scenario** | **Expected Answer Approach** |
|----|-------------|-----------------------------|
| **1** | You need to store a large number of records that are **retrieved frequently but updated rarely**. Which collection will you choose? | `ArrayList` is preferred for fast retrieval (`O(1)`) if ordering is needed, otherwise a `HashSet` for uniqueness with fast lookup (`O(1)`). |
| **2** | You have a scenario where you need a **thread-safe list** but with **high read performance** and occasional writes. Which collection will you use? | `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, since it allows safe iteration without `ConcurrentModificationException` and is optimized for read-heavy scenarios. |
| **3** | You are designing a **LRU Cache**. Which Java collection would you use? | Use `LinkedHashMap` with `accessOrder=true` and override `removeEldestEntry()`. |
| **4** | You need a **sorted list of unique elements** and frequent retrieval operations. Which collection should you use? | `TreeSet` as it maintains **sorted order** and ensures uniqueness (`O(log n)` insertion and retrieval). |
| **5** | Your application requires a **fast lookup for key-value pairs** but should also **maintain insertion order**. Which collection do you choose? | `LinkedHashMap` preserves insertion order while providing `O(1)` lookup time. |
| **6** | You have a **multithreaded application** where multiple threads need to **read and write to a Map**. What will you use? | Use `ConcurrentHashMap`, as it allows **concurrent access** with segment-based locking (better than synchronizing `HashMap`). |
| **7** | You are handling a **priority-based job scheduler**. Which collection should you use? | `PriorityQueue`, as it provides **automatic ordering** based on priority (Min Heap / Max Heap). |
| **8** | How would you **find duplicate elements** in a `List` efficiently? | Use a `Set` to track unique elements, and add elements already present to a `HashSet`. |
| **9** | You need to store elements **in the order they were last accessed** (Least Recently Used order). What will you use? | `LinkedHashMap` with `accessOrder=true`. |
| **10** | You are implementing a **real-time message queue** where multiple consumers retrieve messages **in FIFO order**. Which collection is ideal? | Use `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` (thread-safe) or `ArrayDeque` (for single-threaded scenarios). |
| **11** | You have a collection where **duplicate keys are allowed**, and each key maps to multiple values. Which collection will you use? | Use `Multimap` from **Guava library** or `Map<K, List<V>>`. |
| **12** | You need to store a large dataset and frequently perform **search operations** on it. Which collection will be the most efficient? | `HashSet` or `HashMap` for `O(1)` search time. |
| **13** | You need to implement a **word frequency counter** for a large text file. What data structure should you use? | Use `HashMap<String, Integer>` to count occurrences. |
| **14** | How would you efficiently **remove duplicate elements from an ArrayList**? | Use `new ArrayList<>(new HashSet<>(list))`, but this will lose ordering. Use `LinkedHashSet` if order needs to be preserved. |
| **15** | You have an application where **the highest priority tasks should be processed first**. How do you implement it? | Use `PriorityQueue` with a custom comparator. |
| **16** | You need a **queue where the last inserted element should be removed first** (LIFO behavior). Which collection should you use? | Use `Deque` (`ArrayDeque` or `LinkedList`) and call `pop()/push()`. |
| **17** | How can you efficiently **merge two unsorted lists** and remove duplicates? | Use `Set` (`HashSet` or `LinkedHashSet`) for uniqueness, and then convert it back to a `List`. |
| **18** | How do you efficiently count the **occurrences of each character in a String**? | Use `Map<Character, Integer>` and iterate through the string, updating the count. |
| **19** | You have a **huge dataset that doesn't fit into memory**. How will you perform a **top-K elements retrieval efficiently**? | Use a **Min Heap (PriorityQueue)** to maintain only K largest elements. |
| **20** | You need a **thread-safe, blocking queue**
