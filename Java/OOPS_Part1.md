## What is Data hiding?
* Data hiding in Java is a way to protect the internal details of a class by keeping its data (like variables) private and providing only public methods (functions) to access or change that data. This helps prevent others from directly changing the data in unexpected ways and keeps the inner workings of the class safe and controlled.
* It's like hiding your valuables in a locked box and only letting others use a key to access or change them through a controlled opening.
