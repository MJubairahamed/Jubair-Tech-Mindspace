# Agentic AI (OODA Loop)
## What is Agentic AI ?
* Most current AI systems operate reactively, responding only when prompted and following strict, predefined patterns. This approach limits their ability to handle dynamic situations and truly assist in complex scenarios.
* Agentic AI overcomes these limitations by implementing a multi-layered architecture that enables autonomous operation, continuous learning, and ethical decision-making, allowing AI to become a proactive partner rather than just a tool.
* OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act)

## Some facts about Agentic AI are as follows:
* Operates on Core Principles of autonomous operation, goal-driven behavior, context awareness, and self-improvement.
* Features an Autonomy Engine that enables self-initiated actions and resource management.
* Uses Adaptive Learning to continuously evolve through reinforcement learning and pattern recognition.
* Incorporates a Decision Matrix for real-time risk assessment and scenario simulation.
* Maintains ethical boundaries through a dedicated Governance layer.
* Integrates with other AI agents through a collaborative ecosystem.
* Represents the next evolution in AI, moving from reactive to proactive intelligence.
