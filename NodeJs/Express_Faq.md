Here are the **most important Express.js coding-related interview questions** for a **Senior Software Engineer** role:  

---

### **1. Core Express.js Concepts**
1. **How do you create a simple Express.js server?** *(Write a basic example.)*  
2. **How do you handle different HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) in Express.js?**  
    - In Express.js, I handle different HTTP methods by using the corresponding method functions provided by the Express application object. 
        - For **GET requests**, I use `app.get()`. 
        - For **POST requests** `app.post()`.
        - For **PUT requests** `app.put()`. 
        - For **DELETE requests** `app.delete()`. 
    - Each method takes a route path as the first parameter and a callback function that handles the request and response.
    - For example, to create a basic CRUD API:

        ```javascript
        // GET request to fetch data
        app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
        // Logic to retrieve users
        res.json(users);
        });

        // POST request to create data
        app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
        // Logic to create a new user
        const newUser = req.body;
        users.push(newUser);
        res.status(201).json(newUser);
        });

        // PUT request to update data
        app.put('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
        // Logic to update a user by id
        const userId = req.params.id;
        const updatedData = req.body;
        // Update logic here
        res.json(updatedUser);
        });

        // DELETE request to remove data
        app.delete('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
        // Logic to delete a user by id
        const userId = req.params.id;
        // Delete logic here
        res.status(204).send();
        });
    ```

3. **How does Express.js handle middleware?** *(Explain with a custom middleware example.)**  
   - Express.js handles middleware as a series of functions that intercept requests before they reach the final route handler. These functions have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the chain (next). Middleware functions can perform various tasks, including modifying the request or response objects, executing code, ending the request-response cycle, or passing control to the next middleware. 
   - When an Express application receives a request, it processes it through the middleware functions in the order they were defined. Each middleware function has the opportunity to handle the request or pass it on to the next middleware by calling next(). If a middleware function doesn't call next(), the request-response cycle will be terminated.
   - These functions can perform various tasks, such as logging, authentication, authorization, and data processing.

    ```javascript

    // Custom authentication middleware
    const authenticateUser = (req, res, next) => {
    const authToken = req.headers.authorization;
    
    if (!authToken || !authToken.startsWith('Bearer ')) {
        return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Authentication required' });
    }
    
    const token = authToken.split(' ')[1];
    
    try {
        // Verify the token (in a real app, you'd use JWT or another method)
        const user = verifyToken(token);
        req.user = user; // Attach the user to the request object
        next(); // Call next() to pass control to the next middleware
    } catch (error) {
        return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Invalid or expired token' });
    }
    };

    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();

   // Using the middleware for protected routes
    app.get('/protected-resource', authenticateUser, (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: 'You accessed protected content', user: req.user });
    });

    // You can also apply middleware to all routes
    app.use(authenticateUser);

    // Or to a group of routes using router
    const router = express.Router();
    router.use(authenticateUser);

    app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
    });
    ```

4. **What is the role of `app.use()` in Express.js?**  
    - The app.use() function in Express.js is primarily used to mount middleware functions at a specified path.
    ```javascript
        // This middleware will log the request and 
        // allow it to proceed to the next handler
        app.use(function (req, res, next) {
            console.log("Middleware called");
            next();
        });
    ```
5. **How do you serve static files in Express.js?**  
    - To serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files in Express.js, the **express.static** middleware function can be used. This function takes the root directory of the static assets as an argument.
    ```javascript
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    const path = require('path');

    app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public'))); //constructs the absolute path to the "public" directory

    app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
    });
    ```

### **2. Middleware & Routing**
6. **What are the different types of middleware in Express.js?** *(Application-level, Router-level, Error-handling, Built-in, Third-party)*  
    - **Application-level middleware** - It is bound to the **entire application** using `app.use()` or `app.METHOD()` and is executed for all routes.
    - **Router-level middleware** - It is associated with **specific routes** using `router.use()` or `router.METHOD()` and is executed for routes defined within that router..
    - **Error-handling middleware** - It handles errors during the request-response cycle and is defined with four parameters `(err, req, res, next)`.
    - **Built-in middleware** - It is provided by Express, such as `express.static`, `express.json`, and `express.urlencoded`.
    - **Third-party middleware** - It is developed by external packages, such as `body-parser`, `morgan`, and `cookie-parser`.

7. **How do you create and use custom middleware in Express.js?**  
    ```javascript
    // Custom
    function logRequest(req, res, next) {
    console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
    next();
    }

    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();

    app.use(logRequest);
    ```

8. **How do you define and use route parameters (`req.params`)?** *(Example: `/users/:id`)*  
    - Route parameters in Express.js are named URL segments used to capture values at **specific positions in the URL**. It can be define them by including a colon followed by a parameter name in the route path.
    - For example, with a route like  `/users/:id `, the **id** parameter captures any value in that position of the URL. I can then access these parameters through the  `req.params ` object in my route handler.
    - `const userId = req.params.id;`

9. **What is the difference between `req.query`, `req.params`, and `req.body`?**  
    | Property | Purpose | Source | Example URL/Request | How to Access | When to Use |
    |----------|---------|--------|-------------------|--------------|------------|
    | `req.params` | Capture named route parameters from the URL path | URL path segments marked with `:` | `/users/:id` for `/users/123` | `req.params.id` → "123" | When the data is part of the URL path and represents a resource identifier |
    | `req.query` | Access query string parameters | URL query string (after `?`) | `/search?keyword=express&limit=10` | `req.query.keyword` → "express" | For optional parameters, filtering, sorting, pagination |
    | `req.body` | Access data sent in the request body | Request body (JSON, form data, etc.) | POST to `/users` with JSON body | `req.body.username` → "john_doe" | For data that is too complex or sensitive for URL parameters |

    **Note:** To use `req.body`, you need middleware like `express.json()` or `express.urlencoded()` to parse the request body.

10. **How do you create modular routes using `express.Router()`?**  
    - To create modular routes using express.Router(), I first create separate router files for different resource concerns, then export and mount them in the main application file. This approach helps maintain a clean, organized codebase especially as the application grows.
   - **userRoutes.js** 
    ```javascript
    const express = require('express');
    const router = express.Router();

    // Define routes for the users resource
    router.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: 'Get all users' });
    });

    router.post('/', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: 'Create new user' });
    });

    router.get('/:id', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: `Get user with id ${req.params.id}` });
    });

    router.put('/:id', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: `Update user with id ${req.params.id}` });
    });

    router.delete('/:id', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: `Delete user with id ${req.params.id}` });
    });

    module.exports = router;
    ```
    - **productRoutes.js** 
    ```javascript
    const express = require('express');
    const router = express.Router();

    // Define routes for the products resource
    router.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: 'Get all products' });
    });

    // Other product routes...

    module.exports = router;
    ```
    - **app.js** 
    ```javascript
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();

    // Import route modules
    const userRoutes = require('./routes/userRoutes');
    const productRoutes = require('./routes/productRoutes');

    // Mount the routers at specific paths
    app.use('/users', userRoutes);
    app.use('/products', productRoutes);

    app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3000');
    });
    ```
