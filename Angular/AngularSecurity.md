# Angular security concepts
- **Angular security concepts** is crucial for protecting web applications from common vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, and insecure authentication patterns. 

## Essential Angular Security Concepts (with Simple Definitions)

| **Security Concept** | **What It Means** | **How Angular Helps** | **Example / Notes** |
|----------------------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** | Malicious scripts injected into pages viewed by other users | Angular **auto-sanitizes** HTML, URLs, styles, and bindings | Angular escapes all template values: `{{ userInput }}` |
| **Content Security Policy (CSP)** | A browser feature that prevents inline scripts/styles | Angular encourages external scripts/styles and avoids `eval()` | Add strict CSP headers in server response |
| **DOM Sanitization** | Cleaning untrusted values before inserting into the DOM | Angular uses `DomSanitizer` under the hood | `bypassSecurityTrustHtml()` used carefully for safe HTML |
| **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)** | Forged requests sent from a user’s browser | Angular supports **Xsrf-Token** handling with HttpClient | Angular adds `X-XSRF-TOKEN` header automatically |
| **Authentication** | Verifying user identity | Integrates with **OAuth**, JWT, OpenID Connect, etc. | Use route guards + token-based auth |
| **Authorization (Role-Based Access)** | Controlling user access to routes/components | Implement **route guards**, directive-based access control | `canActivate: [RoleGuard]` in route |
| **Clickjacking Protection** | Preventing your site from being loaded in an iframe | Not Angular-specific, but done via HTTP headers (`X-Frame-Options`) | Use on server (Apache/Nginx) |
| **Secure Routing** | Preventing access to protected views | Use route guards like `CanActivate`, `CanLoad` | Protect admin routes with `AuthGuard` |
| **HTTP Security** | Securing backend communication | Always use **HTTPS** and avoid credentials in query params | Set `withCredentials: true` for CORS, if needed |
| **Safe Template Binding** | Binding untrusted input securely | Angular’s default binding is safe; avoid `[innerHTML]` unless necessary | Use `DomSanitizer` only when needed |
| **Dependency Security** | Avoiding vulnerable libraries | Keep dependencies updated, use audit tools | Run `npm audit` and `ng update` regularly |
| **Environment Separation** | Avoid exposing secrets in front-end code | Use `.env` files or `environment.ts` files properly | Never expose API keys directly in Angular code |

## 🔒 Example – XSS Protection

```html
<!-- Safe Binding (Angular escapes this by default) -->
<p>{{ userInput }}</p>

<!-- Potentially dangerous -->
<div [innerHTML]="userInput"></div> <!-- ❌ XSS risk -->

<!-- Safer with sanitizer -->
<div [innerHTML]="sanitizedHtml"></div>
```

```ts
// In component
constructor(private sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {}

sanitizedHtml = this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustHtml('<strong>Safe</strong>');
```
## ✅ How Angular Handles Security Internally

| Area | Angular's Built-in Protection |
|------|-------------------------------|
| Templates | Escapes values by default to prevent XSS |
| HttpClient | Adds CSRF headers automatically if backend supports it |
| DomSanitizer | Used to sanitize unsafe content like HTML, URLs |
| Routing | Supports guards for route-based access control |
| Dependency Injection | Prevents unauthorized injection with visibility scope |


### 📌 Best Practices for Angular Security
- **Never trust user input** — always validate and sanitize.
- **Use guards** to protect routes and enforce role-based access.
- **Keep Angular and dependencies updated**.
- Avoid `[innerHTML]` unless it's sanitized.
- Use **JWT** properly: store in `HttpOnly` cookies if possible, or `localStorage` with caution.
- Set CSP, X-Frame-Options, and other headers at the **server level**.
