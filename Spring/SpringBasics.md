## **ðŸ”¹ Spring Basics Concepts**
**What is a Spring?**  
Spring Framework is a powerful, open-source framework for building Java applications, particularly enterprise-level applications. It provides comprehensive infrastructure support, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy Java applications. 

**Key Features of Spring Framework:**
1. **Inversion of Control (IoC)** â€“ Uses Dependency Injection (DI) to manage object creation and dependencies.
2. **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)** â€“ Helps in separating cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and transaction management.
3. **Spring MVC** â€“ A framework for building web applications with a Model-View-Controller architecture.
4. **Spring Boot** â€“ A subproject that simplifies Spring application development with auto-configuration and embedded servers.
5. **Spring Data** â€“ Simplifies database access, working with JPA, Hibernate, and NoSQL databases.
6. **Spring Security** â€“ Handles authentication and authorization for applications.
7. **Spring Cloud** â€“ Supports building microservices with features like service discovery, load balancing, and circuit breakers.
8. **Spring Batch** â€“ Facilitates batch processing of large datasets.

**Why Use Spring Framework?**
- Reduces boilerplate code with dependency injection.
- Provides a flexible, modular approach to development.
- Offers integration with various technologies like databases, messaging systems, and cloud platforms.
- Supports both monolithic and microservices architecture.

**What is a Spring Beans?**  
A **Spring Bean** is an object that is instantiated, managed, and controlled by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. Beans are the backbone of a Spring application and are defined in the Spring configuration file (XML-based or Java-based annotations).  

### **Defining a Spring Bean**
#### **1. Using XML Configuration**
```xml
<bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyClass"/>
```

#### **2. Using Java-based Configuration**
```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public MyClass myBean() {
        return new MyClass();
    }
}
```

#### **3. Using Annotations (Component Scanning)**
```java
@Component
public class MyBean {
    // Bean logic
}
```
If using `@ComponentScan`, Spring will automatically detect `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller` annotated classes.

### **Spring Bean Scopes**
Spring provides different scopes to control the lifecycle of beans:
- **Singleton (default)** â€“ One instance per Spring container.
- **Prototype** â€“ A new instance is created every time it is requested.
- **Request (Web Applications)** â€“ One instance per HTTP request.
- **Session (Web Applications)** â€“ One instance per HTTP session.
- **Application (Web Applications)** â€“ One instance per ServletContext.
- **WebSocket (Web Applications)** â€“ One instance per WebSocket connection.

Example of defining a prototype bean:
```java
@Bean
@Scope("prototype")
public MyClass myBean() {
    return new MyClass();
}
```

### **Bean Lifecycle in Spring**
Spring manages the complete lifecycle of a bean:
1. **Instantiation** â€“ The container creates the bean instance.
2. **Dependency Injection** â€“ Dependencies are injected into the bean.
3. **Initialization** â€“ `@PostConstruct` or `init-method` executes.
4. **Usage** â€“ The bean is used in the application.
5. **Destruction** â€“ `@PreDestroy` or `destroy-method` executes before bean removal.

Example:
```java
@Component
public class MyBean {
    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        System.out.println("Bean is initialized.");
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void destroy() {
        System.out.println("Bean is about to be destroyed.");
    }
}
```
